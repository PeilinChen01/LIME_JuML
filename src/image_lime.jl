    predict_fn(input, model, K=1)

Generate prediction probabilities for a given input using the provided model.

# Arguments
- `input`: The input data for which predictions are to be generated.
- `model`: The machine learning model used to make predictions. The model should be callable with the input data.
- `K`: An optional parameter (default is 1). It represents the top K predictions to consider. Currently not used in the function but can be incorporated for future enhancements.

# Returns
- `probs`: The prediction probabilities for the given input, obtained by applying the softmax function to the model's output.

# Description
This function takes an input and a model, generates predictions using the model, and then applies the softmax function to obtain the prediction probabilities. The softmax function ensures that the output probabilities sum to 1, making it suitable for classification tasks.

# Example
```julia
# Define a simple model
model(x) = x * 2  # A dummy model for illustration

# Define an input
input = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

- `probabilities`: A vector containing the prediction probabilities for the specified target class for each perturbed image.

# Description
This function processes a batch of perturbed images, generates predictions for each image using the provided model, and extracts the prediction probabilities for the specified target class. The function performs the following steps:
1. Permute the dimensions of each image to match the model's expected input format.
2. Reshape the image to ensure compatibility with the model.
3. Convert the image to a `Float32` array.
4. Generate prediction probabilities using the `predict_fn` function.
5. Extract the prediction probability for the specified target class and store it in a vector.

```julia
# Define a simple model
model(x) = x * 2  # A dummy model for illustration

# Create a vector of perturbed images (dummy images for illustration)

"""
    calculate_similarity(img, perturbed_images::Vector)

Calculate the similarity between the original image and each perturbed image using the L2 norm.

# Arguments
- `img`: The original image. It should be in the same format as the perturbed images.
- `perturbed_images::Vector`: A vector containing perturbed versions of the original image.

# Returns
- `similarities`: A vector containing the similarity values for each perturbed image, where higher values indicate greater similarity to the original image.

# Description
This function calculates the similarity between the original image and each perturbed image. The similarity is computed using the L2 norm (Euclidean distance) between the images. The L2 norm is calculated for each perturbed image with respect to the original image. The similarity is then computed as the exponential of the negative distance. Finally, the similarity values are inverted (1 - similarity) to emphasize higher similarity values for closer distances.

# Example
```julia
# Define the original image (dummy image for illustration)
original_image = rand(224, 224, 3)

    weighted_probabilities(probabilities::Vector, similarities::Vector)

Calculate the weighted probabilities by multiplying the probabilities by the similarities.

# Arguments
- `probabilities::Vector`: A vector of probabilities predicted by the model for each perturbed image.
- `similarities::Vector`: A vector of similarity values between the original image and each perturbed image.

# Returns
- `weighted_probs`: A vector containing the weighted probabilities, where each probability has been scaled by its similarity to the original image.

# Description
This function computes the weighted probabilities for each perturbed image. Each probability is multiplied by its corresponding similarity value, which is a measure of how similar the perturbed image is to the original image. The resulting weighted probabilities give more importance to perturbed images that are more similar to the original image.

The point-wise multiplication of the `probabilities` vector and the `similarities` vector is performed element-wise.

# Example

# Define the predicted probabilities for perturbed images (dummy values for illustration)

Perform Lasso regression to fit a model using weighted probabilities and deactivated superpixels.

# Arguments
- `weighted_probs::Vector`: A vector of weighted probabilities for the perturbed images. Each probability is multiplied by the similarity between the perturbed image and the original image.
- `deactivated_superpixels::BitMatrix`: A binary matrix where each row represents a perturbed image and each column represents a superpixel. The value is `true` if the superpixel is deactivated in that perturbed image and `false` otherwise.

# Description
This function performs Lasso regression to learn a sparse linear model that explains the relationship between the perturbed images and their corresponding weighted probabilities. The Lasso regression will be used to select the most important superpixels by applying L1 regularization.

- `X` is the design matrix containing binary features indicating which superpixels are deactivated for each perturbed image.
- `y` is the vector of weighted probabilities associated with each perturbed image.
- The `Lasso` function from the `Lasso` package is used to fit the Lasso regression model, which performs L1 regularization to select a subset of features (superpixels) that best explain the weighted probabilities.

# Returns

The coefficients reflect how much each superpixel contributes to the model's prediction for the target class. This function creates an image where each pixel's value is determined by the coefficient of the superpixel to which it belongs, making it easier to visualize which superpixels are most influential for the prediction.

1. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Reshapes the input tensor and converts it to a `RGB` image.
   
2. **Superpixel Segmentation**:
   - Applies Felzenszwalb's algorithm to segment the image into superpixels.

3. **Generate Perturbed Images**:
   - Creates perturbed versions of the image by deactivating different superpixels.

4. **Process Perturbed Images**:
   - Feeds the perturbed images through the model to obtain class probabilities.

5. **Calculate Similarity**:
   - Computes the similarity between the original and perturbed images.

6. **Weight Data**:
   - Weighs the probabilities based on the similarity measures.
